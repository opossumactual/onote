## Download

Download the latest release for your platform:

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| Windows | [onote_x64-setup.exe](https://github.com/opossumactual/onote/releases/latest) |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | [onote_aarch64.dmg](https://github.com/opossumactual/onote/releases/latest) |
| macOS (Intel) | [onote_x64.dmg](https://github.com/opossumactual/onote/releases/latest) |
| Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) | [onote_amd64.deb](https://github.com/opossumactual/onote/releases/latest) |
| Linux (Fedora/RHEL) | [onote_x86_64.rpm](https://github.com/opossumactual/onote/releases/latest) |
| Linux (Universal) | [onote_amd64.AppImage](https://github.com/opossumactual/onote/releases/latest) |

### macOS Installation

Since the app isn't signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it by default. After downloading and moving to Applications:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/onote.app
```

Then open the app normally. You only need to run this once per download.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+N` | New note |
| `Ctrl+R` | Start/stop recording |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save note |
| `Ctrl+B` | Toggle sidebar |
| `Ctrl+L` | Toggle note list |
| `Ctrl+/` | Show all shortcuts |
| `Delete` | Delete selected note |
| `Esc` | Close dialogs |

## How It Works

1. **Record** - Click the record button or press `Ctrl+R`
2. **Transcribe** - Audio is processed locally using Whisper AI
3. **Edit** - Transcription appears in your note, ready to edit
4. **Save** - Notes are saved as markdown files in `~/Documents/opnotes/`

### Note Titles

The first line of each note becomes its title in the sidebar. When you finish typing the title and press Enter, the sidebar updates instantly. Titles can optionally start with `#` for markdown heading style.

### Whisper Models

On first use, you'll need to download a Whisper model in Settings:

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| tiny.en | 75 MB | Fastest | Good |
| base.en | 142 MB | Fast | Better |
| small.en | 466 MB | Medium | Great |
| medium.en | 1.5 GB | Slow | Best |

Models are stored locally:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/opnotes/models/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/opnotes/models/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\opnotes\models\`
